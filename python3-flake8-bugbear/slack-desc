# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

python3-flake8-bugbear: python3-flake8-bugbear (A plugin for Flake8)
python3-flake8-bugbear:
python3-flake8-bugbear: A plugin for flake8 finding likely bugs and design problems in
python3-flake8-bugbear: your program. Contains warnings that don’t belong in pyflakes
python3-flake8-bugbear: and pycodestyle. It is felt that these lints don’t belong in the
python3-flake8-bugbear: main Python tools as they are very opinionated and do not have a
python3-flake8-bugbear: PEP or standard behind them. Due to flake8 being designed to be
python3-flake8-bugbear: extensible, the original creators of these lints believed that a
python3-flake8-bugbear: plugin was the best route. This has resulted in better development
python3-flake8-bugbear: velocity for contributors and adaptive deployment for flake8 users.
